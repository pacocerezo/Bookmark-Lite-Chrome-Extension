# Bookmark Lite

Bookmark Lite is a Chrome Extension build with Vanilla JS which uses LocalStorage and Google APIs to make temporary bookmarking easy.

Most web searches have a limited time of interest, with Bookmark Lite you can track webpages on the topic that matters to you right now (travel destinations, tutorials, purchases...) and delete them when you finish your task with a simple click. 

## Installation

->Download the repository zip, extract it in a folder.

->Open Chrome browser and head over the address: chrome://extensions

->Enable "Developer mode" (Top right corner)

->Click on "Load unpacked"

->Choose the folder where you saved the files when unzipping


Bookmark Lite extension should be already available in Chrome (Puzzle icon)

## Usage
You can add bookmarks by writing an address in the box (Click "Save input") or by storing the current webpage you are visiting (Click "Save Tab").

Your tracking websites will be visible on the extension main pop-up and when clicked they'll open in a new tab.  

Clicking "Delete All" or cleaning your browser data will empty the tracker list.
